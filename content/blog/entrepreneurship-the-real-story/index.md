## What is a startup, and what does it mean to run the business by yourself.

The whole journey of creating is a merry go ride, depending on the type of 
the company you choose a whole lot of compliances that go around the company creation is
staggering, but it is a necessity.

Being a founder of a startup you are wholly responsible for everything that goes around 
the company. Generates sales, make sure your operational expenses are taken care of.
You make sure that are up to date about the competition around you. You make sure,
that the product you give out to the customer is of superior quality, Tested, Retested
and is up to your expected standards before you roll out the product.

It is also your responsibility that you are ahead of your competition so that you have
that edge in your product that your competitor lacks.

Being a founder you are,

01. a Clerk
02. a Cleaner
03. a Marketing Person
04. a Sales Person
05. an Accounting Executive
06. a Bookkeeping Executive
07. a Manager
08. a Research Associate
09. an HR executive
10. a Tax Executive 
11. a Purchase Executive
12. an Inventory keeper

If you are a founder you do not have a fixed role, you have to juggle all these roles.
Some feel you can outsource these jobs and relax, but sorry to break that myth if you are
a founder you yourself will have to involve in these activities because its your
blood and sweat that you pour into your startup if there is no involvement then your
startup would be a herd of sheep without a shepherd.

**Operation Expense:** Rent, Electricity Charges, Salary all these things are termed as 
operational expense. 

### Startup its pros.

First and foremost being a founder of your own company has its advantages.
1. You can plan your work at your convenience. 
2. You can give yourself a holiday.
3. With The sheer amount of knowledge that you have to keep yourself updated, you will
   certainly have an edge on those who perform jobs in typical MNC.
4. You can certainly decide your salary yourself, you will be entitled to a
   share of the dividend if the company becomes profitable.

The sheer amount of work that you do in a typical startup and the roles that you have to
manage simultaneously gives you that amount of exposure and experience these typical MNCs
that will not be able to provide.

Being a startup you are expected to be fast and break things, that was the typical principle,
Facebook and Google were founded upon. You move fast and break things.

You will have to be a financial planner when you become a founder because there will be days
where there will be no sales in your company and you will have to survive on your savings,
if you do not plan it then you will be regretting it later.

**MNC:** Multinational corporations like IBM, Google, Amazon, TCS, JP Morgan, or Any company
that is outside India typical countries include the USA, Europe, Australia, Japan, South Korea 
, typically if you are in these companies Indian society seems to think you are settled for life. 

### Startup its cons.

Being a founder has its pros and its cons, I will be talking about some of the cons,
1. For society you will typically encourage your neighbour's son/daughter to create his own
   the company but when it comes to your own son/daughter you think it risky and will not 
   allow it.
2. You will have to go against your family, your relatives, your friends, your cousins
   the society if you have to fulfill your dream. Not one person will encourage you,
   not one person will support you the only thing you will typically hear is "If 
   you had got a job like 'name of relative/cousin/neighbor son' then you will not 
   have to struggle so much.
3. Its emotional draining and taxing, you will have to explain your dream to your family/
   your siblings/your cousins/your relatives each and every day, until the day, come when 
   your startup is successful.
4. If you have found a partner in life then you are lucky, but if not, then better luck finding
   a bride/ partner, no one will get their son/daughter married to a startup founder because
   its risky 50% of the typical startups fail, so no one would want their partner to be a failure in
   life, or if I talk in terms of money, you are not stable you do not have a stable income source.

You have to have tremendous willpower to counter these. Sometimes when things do not work out, you
will question yourself if you have taken the right decision in your life or not, that is when having
a co-founding team member helps.

Being a startup founder is highly risky, you will not have a stable income source, you yourself are
responsible for the success and failure of your company.

### What I think a startup is.

This can be summarised in this Bhagavad Gita verse,

>Karmanye vadhikaraste Ma Phaleshu Kadachana,
>Ma Karmaphalaheturbhurma Te Sangostvakarmani

>You have the right to work only but never to its fruits.
>Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.

So being a startup founder is just like, "We can do the work but not expect the benefits of work"

Being a founder or creating or running a startup is not an easy task. Besides the societal and parental
pressure running a successful startup takes a heavy toll mentally and physically. You get inspired by Facebook
and Google moving fast and breaking things, what will also happen is you will eventually break yourself
if you do not take time off for yourself.

If you get inspired by News nowadays and jump into a startup by returns or expecting your startup to be 
brought off by MNC, then don't. News will publish stories of success not of failure or struggle,
If you are willing to put in the hard work have unlimited will power and have a passion to work without 
pay year on year then and only then create a startup or work in a startup or else you are better of
work for an MNC having a stable income source.

Everyone has his own dreams his on terms for living his life, and if you encounter any startup founder
explaining his idea passionately, don't judge he is living his life on his own terms just as you are.

I would like to end the post by saying I run a startup known as Robo Bionics,(https://robobionics.in),
it has been 6 years, there are times when I felt like leaving it and joining an MNC but, my passion and my
co-founding team won't allow me, I am at that stage of life where I should be married and living with a kid,
but here I am following my passion, running my startup I am happy that is what matters. Money problems will
come and go but the experiences and knowledge you gain will last lifelong.

I would really like to thank my co-founding team, Llewellyn and Priyanka, my friends who still think that
running my startup is cool, and try to support me in whichever way possible and my parents and sister who
although complain a lot still support my dream and my startup.
