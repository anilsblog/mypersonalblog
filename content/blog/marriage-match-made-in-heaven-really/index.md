## What is Marriage? Why do we need one?

In a world, where your number of single friends keeps dwindling day by day you feel the need
Keeping company with someone for a lifetime is a basic human need.

According to me, marriage is a bond between two partners committed to live, the same belief 
is solidified when I look at my parent's marriage and that of my friends.

I may be wrong but that is the assumption I gathered through experience.

So, we can all agree that we marry so that we have a partner whom we can share our journey with.

**What a bunch of Nonsense!!:** Yeah sure, I never expect the reader to agree with me, that is 
why we live in a democratic country?

### How to find your soulmate/partner/bride/groom etc...

There are many options we have a lot of matrimony websites, apps, and new startups working
on finding you the perfect partner, and why would they not the Arranged Marriage industry 
is valued at billion dollars. This is business.

Now, a lot of them have found their partner through such apps and websites, That's a good
thing otherwise you would like to question those who give testimonials to such
apps and websites.

Now let me describe my experience, All these things run on subscriptions and they are not
cheap, sure you can run the free tier lifelong but if you want to speak to someone free tier
won't help you there. You can bypass this by searching the name on social media websites,
but they also have patched this issue by only showing the first letter. Now if you 
try to search for someone with only a letter that starts with an 'A' good luck with that.

Numbers is a prime game here, you won't join a matrimony website/app if they have only 10 users,
so the identity of the users in these things is a bit spooky. To get you hooked, all they do is 
send you an email "Someone is interested in your profile" to see the profile and buy a subscription
when you buy one either the user does not exist or the user does not have contact information.
All these apps and websites are only trying to make money they were never interested in getting you
a partner, or else how will they pay for the hosting charges, rent, and salaries of the employees
who work there and earn a profit, if they were so interested in your wellbeing they won't be calling 
you 24x7 to buy their subscription. And the bonus is they won't delete the profiles of people who are
married/engaged, why is that again? Numbers you want to show growing numbers and memberships,
not a declining trend else people won't buy the subscription.

I personally have tried these apps and websites, once they get your number then the call starts,
I have given the following reasons fed up with their calls,

1. I am hospitalized, Can't talk now.
2. I am engaged.
3. I am married.
4. I don't live in India anymore.

But the calls kept coming, the bad thing is every time a new person calls so they don't have your
history they repeat the script that is told to them. Now if you look at my above-listed reason,
I already mention to them that I am married, then how come my profile still exists on their website?
Now, I am still unmarried but the point I am trying to make is even after informing them they 
have not deleted my profile, probably an email to tech support will solve the issue. or will it?

**I got married from so and so app within a month, what are you saying man? You are a person who hates matrimony websites:**
Great, you are one lucky person.

### The ideal groom/bride

An ideal groom/bride is described as follows,
1. if 30+ in managerial position earning CTC of 20 Lakhs an above, else 15 Lakhs and above (Adjust the CTC for inflation each year also) 
2. living in a metro city like Mumbai, Banglore, or Pune (Not Vasai, technically Vasai is outside Mumbai so bad luck Vasaikars)
3. living in a flat registered in his name, and has the plan to relocate outside India in the coming years (The grass is always greener when the country is not India and in the West)
4. working in an MNC is a must, or else your package must be equal to that of the CEO of the company you are working for.

Such people find marriage in these apps and websites, these are the people who give them testimonials.
If you are not in the ideal category, then hard luck keep on searching.

What I find the ridiculous things that some people write here,
1. Annual income in dollars, dinars, etc, etc (if you have to find a partner with annual income in dollars, maybe you have registered in the wrong country)
2. Inter City Filters,e.g. you are staying in Mumbai Central you don't want the groom/bride to come from say Virar. (This is a bit farfetched if you ask me)
3. Introduction of Upper-Middle Class, which I don't know who coined that term either you are rich or you are middle class or poor, what the hell is upper-middle class?
   I won't be surprised if someone added Ultimate-Middle class in the coming years.

You can expect a whole lot of things from the bride/groom but ultimately its the life they have to build together, a whole lot of adjustments and sacrifices has
to be made if you want to keep the marriage intact. 

### Matrimony websites are not ideal for struggling startup founders (Money matters)

One of the repeated things which I hear every time I say I am a startup founder is,
1. Not interested in business.
2. Startup founder ewwwww.
3. Is the startup funded enough? (People who watch Shark Tank India)
4. Owns a business, not interested.

And with the funding winter things seems bleak, not with the funding part per se but the arranged marriage part.

Either you have to be in the Ideal Groom/ Bride category or else keep waiting.

And there is also horoscope, caste, and another whole lot of things that come into the picture, which I cannot
go into because, I hardly understand these things, and I cannot comment on things I don't understand.

To be frank, my parents and sister had forewarned me about the same, but I felt following my
dream and passion are way better than following a pattern that society dictates.

So, Society is taking revenge on me. :D. Do I regret it, heck no. :P

This has something to do with how businesses and startups are perceived. A person owning a startup is by nature volatile his startup can close any day, true.
But so are some of the MNCs and businesses, if there are no clients any businesses, if no business then the cost-cutting starts, the fancy 20 Lakhs CTC
a person is the first who gets the boot from the same MNC.

Any business you take takes time to set credibility and takes time to become profit-making, success cannot be achieved overnight.

### What is my take on this?

I started this journey 2 years back, and I still get the same answers which I mentioned above from Grooms Parents.

Will I get married or not, depends on my luck and my horoscopes maybe.:P

A few things which I have started doing are,
1. Create a fund to arrange for a caretaker when I am old. (Dude think positively all will be okay, FYI its called thinking practically)
2. Since the marriage fund won't be required the same can be allocated to my would-be nephew's education and my god-daughters education at later date.
3. Save money to buy that home theater system and 100-inch tv.
4. Complete my Executive MBA, for which I got a scholarship from a foreign university. (Foreigners have more faith in me than my own country's people :P)
5. Stopped attending marriage ceremonies until I get married. (Dude are you a child, Yes I am entitled to my own happiness and fancies as I desire)
   See it this way I am taking revenge on Society.:P

Finally, marriage is something very personal, and every person has their own likes and dislikes, Like a career, and a struggle-free life, I understand all that, 
But someone said if your ECG has a straight line in the monitor then you are pretty much dead, there are bumps in the ECG to keep life interesting.

No success without struggle, no winning without hard work.
