## What is Marriage? Why do we need one?

In a world,where your number of single friends keep dwindling day by day you feel the need
keep company with someone for lifetime is basic human need.

According to me marriage is a bond between two partners committed to life, the same belief 
is solidified when i look at my parents marriage and that of my friends.

I may be wrong but that is the assumption i gathered through experience.

So, we can all agree that we marry so that we have partner whom we can share our journey with.

**What a bunch of Nonsense!!:** Yeah sure, i never expect the reader to agree with me, that is 
why we live in a democratic country.

### How to find your soulmate/partner/bride/groom etc etc...

There are many options we a have lot of matrimony websites, app, new startups working
on to find you the perfect partner, and why would they not the Arranged Marriage industry 
is valued at <number>. This is business.

Now, lot of them have found thier partner through such apps and websites, Thats a good
thing otherwise you would really like to question those who give testimonials to such
apps and websites.

Now let me describe my experience, All theses things run on subscriptions and they are not
cheap, sure you can run the free tier lifelong but if you want to speak to someone free tier
wont help you there. You can bypass this by searching the name on social media websites,
but they also have patched this issue by only showing the first letter. Now if you 
try to search someone with only a letter that starts with a 'A' good luck on that.

Numbers is a prime game here, you wont join a matrimony website/app if they have only 10 users,
so identity of the users in these things is a bit spooky. To get you hooked, all they do is 
send you an email "Someone is intrested in your profile" to see the profile buy subscription
when you buy one either the user does not exsists or the user does not have a contact information.
All these apps and websites are only try to make money they were never intrested in getting you
a partner, or else how will they pay for the hosting charges, rent and salaries of the employess
who work there and earn profit, if they were so intrested in your wellbeing they wont be calling 
you 24x7 to buy thier subscription. And the bonus is they wont delete the profiles of people who are
married / engaged, why is that again? Numbers you want to show growing numbers and memberships,
not a declining trend else people wont buy the subscription.

I personally have tried these apps and website, once they get your number then the call starts,
i have given the following reasons fedup of thier calls,

1. I am hospitalized, Cant talk now.
2. I am engaged.
3. I am married.
4. I dont live in India anymore.

But the calls kept coming, the bad thing is everytime a new person calls so they dont have your
history they repeat the script that is told to them. Now if you look at my above listed reason,
I already mention them that i am married, then how come my profile still exsists in their website?
Now, i am still unmarried but the point i am trying to make is even after informing them they 
have not deleted my profile, probably an email to the tech support will solve the issue? or will it?

**I got married from so and so app within a month, what are you saying man. You are person who hates matrimony websites:**
Great, you are one lucky person.

### The ideal groom/bride

An ideal groom/bride is described as follows,
1. if 30+ in managerial position earning CTC of 20 Lakhs an above, else 15 Lakhs and above (Adjust the CTC for inflation each year also) 
2. living in a metro city like Mumbai,Banglore,Pune (Not Vasai, technically Vasai is outside Mumbai so bad luck Vasaikars)
3. living in a flat registered in his name, and has a plan to relocate outside India in coming years (Grass is always greener when country is not India and in the West)
4. working in a MNC is a must, or else you package must be equal to that of CEO of the company you are working.

Such people find marriage in these apps and websites, these are the people who gives them the testimonials.
If you are not in the ideal category, then hard luck keep on searching.

What i find the ridicous things that some people write here,
1. Annual income in dollars,dinars, etc etc (if you have to find a partner with annual income in dollars, maybe you have registered in wrong country)
2. Inter City Filters,e.g. you are staying in Mumbai Central you dont want the groom / bride to come from say Virar. (This is a bit farfetched, if you ask me)
3. Introduction of Upper-Middle Class, which i dont know who coined that term either you are rich or you are middle class or poor, what the hell is upper-middle class?
   i wont be surprised if someone added Ultimate-Middle class in coming years.

You can expect a whole lot of things from the bride / groom but utlimately its the life they have to build together, a whole lot of adjustments and sacrificies has
to be made if you want to keep the marriage intact. 

### Matrimony websites not ideal for struggling startup founders (Money matters)

One of the repeated things which i hear everytime i say i am a startup founder is,
1. Not intrested in business.
2. Startup founder ewwwww.
3. Is the startup funded enough? (People who watch Shark Tank India)
4. Owns a business, not intrested.

And with the funding winter things seems bleek, not with the funding part per se but the arranged marriage part.

Either you have to be in the Ideal Groom/ Bride category or else keep waiting.

And there is also horoscope,caste and other whole lot of things that come into a picture, which i cannot
go into because,i hardly understand these things, and i cannot comment on things i dont understand.

To be frank, my parents and sister had forewarned me about the same, but i felt following my
dream and passion is way better than following a pattern that society dictates.

So, Society is taking revenge on me. :D. Do i regret it, heck no. :P

This has something to do how, business and startups is percieved. A person owning startup, is by nature volatile his startup can close anyday, true.
But so are some of the MNC's and businesses, if there is no clients no business, if no business then the cost cutting starts, the fancy 20 Lakhs CTC
person is the first who gets the boot by the same MNC's.

Any business you take, takes time to set credibility and takes time to become profit making, success cannot be achieved overnight.

### What is my take on this.

I had started this journey 2 years back, and i still get the same answers which i mentioned above from Grooms Parents.

Will i get married or not, depends on my luck and my horoscopes maybe.:P

Few things which i have started doing,
1. Create a fund to arrange for a caretaker when i am old. (Dude think positively all will be okay, FYI its called thinking practically)
2. Since marriage fund wont be required the same can be alloted to my would be nephews education and my god-daughters education at later date.
3. Save money to buy that home theater system and 100 inch tv.
4. Complete my Executive MBA, for which i got a scholarship from foreign university. (Foreigners have more faith in me than my own country people :P)
5. Stopped attending marriage cerimonies until i get married. (Dude are you a child, Yes i am entilled to my own happiness and fancies as i desire)
   See it this way i am taking revenge on Society.:P

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule and reading my blog.
