description: Reason why humans are always unhappy.

As a human race, we always chased happiness.

## Society is Happy, We are happy.

We as humans always prefer the herd mentality. If the Society is doing something
we happily adopt it. We feel if society at large is doing it, if they are happy 
by it's transient property, we would also be happy.

Let me explain with an example.

Engineering ... at large in the Society.
Being called an engineer is a matter of pride to parents.
And to add to it that if the child is doing engineering from a prestigious institution, 
then that becomes bragging statements for the parents in front of relatives.

But in all this, does the parent ask whether the child is comfortable with engineering, or the  
child is comfortable with any other branch rather than taking up sciences. This question does not arise
simply because we have been bombarded with ads showcasing the might if one becomes an engineer, so
the child is rather forced into doing what he does not like thereby sacrificing the child's happiness.
A major cause of convern is also because the child is bound to cater to parent's wishes and 
are forced to think about the societal stand that the parents will have if they pursue engineering.

**Moral:** To keep the society happy, a child has to sacrifice his happiness.


### Social Media Craze

We all are affected by things that are happening on social media. People are bombarded 
by content/stories where every person using a particular product seems happy all the time. 
We all buy products advertised by famous personalities because we are made to believe
that the product us being used by them and hence it is a great product.

The product/technology the celebrities are using must be a great product, but we never
question it or try to fit into our needs. We buy the product regardless of our need, and
when the product in question does not fulfill our needs then we tend to be unhappy.

**Moral:** Celebrity endorsement of the product will never translate to our need for the product.

### Outrage or misdirected unhappiness

We as a Society are outraged by each and everything right now.

1.  Waiting in Queue - Outraged by Slow Queue
2.  Traffic on the Road - Outraged by Slow Traffic
3.  Bad food at Restaurant - Outraged by Bad Food

Once we find something we don't like, our immediate reaction is to post
it to social media without even blinking. So that a lot more people
will follow or see your post and become more outraged and then the same
cycle repeats all over again.

> At any point in time we never wait and analyze things, our immediate reaction
> would be post it to social media if we wait and analyze things we will see
> and understand the things from the perspective of another user. 

What I recommend is, analyze the things first before posting, if you feel
that even after speaking/analyzing things are not improving, then posting
to social media is justified, "Heck you get greater customer support when
you post things to social media".

And people reading such posts written in a range must analyze things first before 
we judging someone or passing a comment someone. The same thing happens with Whatsapp 
forwards. When someone forwards you any image or a video analyse it first before forwarding the same
to a group of people or any other person. What separates us from other animals
is the ability to think critically. Use that ability once in a while.

**Moral:** Misdirected happiness should never be directed towards outrage.

#### News Media - Boon or Poison

Journalism is seen as the fourth pillar of democracy, the ability a
journalist to investigate and present news to common people requires lots
of dedication and will. But unfortunately, news media nowadays are not a
reliable source of information.

News media houses have turned into trial rooms, When in a country there already
exists High courts and Supreme Courts. News media houses are running behind the culprit
trying to trace the whereabouts of the culprit when there is already CBI, Police, 
and existing investigating agencies present. These are some of the signs where
the reliability of News media must be questioned.

But, the reality is the consumers/people want such content hence the news media houses 
are showing them. The news media houses don't publish such content unless people want them to.

That brings us to the end of my blog. My suggestion would be to stop seeing 
content where such a circus is created in form of news. When the news media
houses realize that such content will not be tolerated by the common man and their 
ad revenue will dip, they will course correct themselves.

**Moral:** Don't watch what you don't like.

I would like to end the post by saying that happiness and unhappiness depend
on how an individual deals with it. And one more interesting thing about humans
beings is that we achieve happiness by solving our problems. So, next time instead 
of running away from problems if we have embrace it and solve it out. Our happiness will 
know no bounds.
